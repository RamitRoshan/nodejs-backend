# Q). built a server using only nodejs 

- For settinng server nodejs gives http

- Request listener is used as a call back fn in backend (nodejs)

- backend: requestListener  :: frontend : eventListener (at the end of the days these are callback fns)

- Call back fn -why? <br>
function passes as an argument to another fn, to be executed at a later point in time.
