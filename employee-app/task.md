# Create a simple full-stack application using Node.js for the backend and plain JavaScript for the frontend.
	•	The backend should expose a single API endpoint that returns an array of employee records (each record should contain at least an id, name, title, and email).
	•	The frontend should display a button labeled “Fetch Employee Details”.
	•	When the button is clicked, the frontend should call the backend API, retrieve the employee records, and render them as a list on the page.
